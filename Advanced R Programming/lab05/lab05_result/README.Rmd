# rLab5

The goal of rLab5 is to create a R package to read from an API, in our case from APIXU.com which provides weather API.

## Installation

You can install the released version of rLab5 from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rLab5")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lennartsc/rLab5")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
library(rLab5)
get_data("Bangalore", 1)
```

```{r shiny example, eval=FALSE}
## shiny app
library(rLab5)
