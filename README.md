## Courses in detail

For every course, a general description about its contents is given. In many courses we have worked - in groups as well as individually - on so-called labs in which the theoretically presented contents from the lectures were directly applied in practice. In this case, the labs are also described in detail in this section. You also have the possibility to access the corresponding files.

### Philosophy of Science (3 ECTS)

**Course description**

Philosophy of science is an attempt to give an account of what science is, and what it is that distinguishes science from other activities. This can be done in several different ways, for instance by studying the history of science, that is, studying how people in different periods have viewed scientific activities. It could also be studied in a more sociological manner, examining how science is organized today. The focus of this course is more normative, however: the main issue is to examine how science should be conducted, what it is that distinguishes good science from bad science, or science from pseudo-science. Focusing on the normative aspects of science will involve studying what a scientific theory is, how a scientific theory is related to observation, and what a scientific theory will tell us about the world.

No labs. Content was taught exclusively theoretically in the form of lectures and written assignments.
